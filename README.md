# AI-Agent-Browser-Control
This is a simple clone of OpenAi operator

This repository provides a Python-based solution for controlling and automating browser tasks using Playwright. It also integrates with Google's Generative AI (`genai`) to dynamically generate and execute Python code for automating browser interactions. The project is a simple implementation inspired by OpenAI's operator functionalities.
